      <h1>Evictions in Boston</h1>
      <p>
        Boston has seen a concerning rise in evictions, especially among
        marginalized communities. Rent burdens, lack of affordable housing,
        and uneven legal protections have contributed to widespread housing
        insecurity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evictions not only displace families but also disrupt lives â€” affecting
        education, employment, and mental health. This project explores
        how different racial and ethnic groups are impacted by eviction in the
        city.
